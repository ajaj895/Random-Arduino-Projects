# Random-Arduino-Projects
This is a collection of small Arduino programs and CircuitPython projects that I have been working on

The CircuitPython code is ment to be run on an Adafruit Metro M0.

None of these programs should rely on another (other than arduino libs) so you can consider each a standalone, unless otherwise posted.
